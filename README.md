## More About The Site

**Flower Recognizer** is a web application powered by a Neural Network (NN) using TensorFlow that can identify different flower types based on an image uploaded by the user.

### 1Ô∏è- AI Module

The AI model was trained using **TensorFlow** with the [Oxford Flowers 102 dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/oxford_flowers102), which contains images of 102 flower species. The dataset is split as follows:

- **Training Set:** 6,149 labeled images  
- **Validation Set:** 1,020 labeled images  
- **Testing Set:** 1,020 labeled images  

To improve accuracy, I utilized a **pre-trained MobileNetV2 model** from [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/mobilenet_v2/feature_vector/4), freezing its weights and attaching my custom classifier on top.

The neural network was trained for **12 epochs** using:
- **Optimizer:** `Adam`
- **Loss Function:** `SGD`
- **Early Stopping:** 5 patience

After training, the model achieved **90% accuracy** on the test set and was saved in **H5 format** for deployment.

### 2Ô∏è- Frontend

The user interface (`index.html`) is hosted on **GitHub Pages** and developed using:
- **HTML/CSS** for structure and styling  
- **JavaScript** to interact with the backend  

---

### 3- Backend

The backend (`app.py`) is implemented in **Python** using **Flask** to:
- Handle image uploads  
- Preprocess the image  
- Run model inference  
- Return the predicted flower name  

The application is deployed on **Render**, ensuring seamless hosting and accessibility.
